I'm an offensive security enthusiast. I love breaking things and am always eager to learn new skills and techniques and stay up-to-date on the latest threats and vulnerabilities to enhance my security knowledge and capabilities.

My passion for offensive security and penetration testing led me to obtain my BSCP, CAPen, CEH Practical and a few other certifications. I plan to enroll in further offensive security courses in the future.

I spend much of my free time on HackTheBox and CTFTime and have participated in renowned Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions, winning several prizes. Apart from security, I enjoy reading about stoicism and psychology.
